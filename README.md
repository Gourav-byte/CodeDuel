| **Winner Declaration**<br>One who submits first will win the duel | ![Winner](media/Code_winner_declaration.png) |




##  How It Works

> üõ†Ô∏è The extension is **not yet published** on the VS Code Marketplace. You‚Äôll need to run it in development mode:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**.
3. Press `F5` to launch a **development instance** of VS Code with the extension loaded.
4. In the new window, use the command palette or UI to **start a duel**, share the `roomId` with a friend, and begin!

üí° The backend is already deployed, so you **do not need to run `node server/server.js`** unless you plan to self-host or contribute to server-side changes.
