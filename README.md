# ‚öîÔ∏è CodeDuel - Competitive Coding Battles in VS Code

**CodeDuel** is a VS Code extension that lets you challenge your friends to real-time competitive programming duels ‚Äî without ever leaving your editor.The one who gets an accepted solution first ‚Äî wins. It's built to bring the thrill of competitive programming duels directly inside your code editor.

> Compete. Code. Win. All inside VS Code.

- Compete head-to-head by solving the same Codeforces problem  
- See who submits first and wins ‚Äî results shown live in VS Code  
- Log in with your Codeforces ID to get started

##  Features

-  Random Codeforces problem generator
-  Real-time room-based duels between two coders
-  Automatic winner detection using Codeforces API
-  Pre-filled test cases for each problem
-  Run test cases directly into VS Code.
-  Clean, minimal UI integrated into VS Code
-  Secure and battle-tested backend hosted on Railway

## WorkFlow
- **Open a Folder**
  Open a folder using VS Code .

- **Start a Duel**  
  Use the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run the `Start Duel` command. Share the generated **Room ID** with a friend.

- **Join a Duel**  
  Your friend runs the `Join Duel` command and enters the shared Room ID. Once both players are in, the duel begins.

- **Same Problem, Same Time**  
  A random Codeforces problem is fetched for both players ‚Äî Both gets the exact same challenge.

Here‚Äôs a quick walkthrough of how CodeDuel works inside VS Code:

| Action | Preview |
|--------|---------|
| **Start a Duel** <br>Press F5 and then Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) to open the Command Palette. Enter your User ID, then a room ID will be generated. Pass it to your friend. | ![Start a Duel](media/Code_copy_roomid.png) |
| **Join a Duel**<br>Use the command Join Duel in command palette | ![Join Duel](media/Code_join_duel.png) |
| **Enter Room ID**<br>Enter the room ID to connect. | ![Enter Room ID](media/Code_enter_roomId.png) |
| **Problem Delivered**<br>Problem statement appears side-by-side with your code editor. | ![Problem Statement](media/Code_duel_begins.png) |
| **Run Sample Test**<br>Check sample input/output inside VS Code only | ![Sample Test](media/Code_while_solving.png) |
| **Winner Declaration**<br>One who submits first will win the duel | ![Winner](media/Code_winner_declaration.png) |



## Technologies Used

- VS Code Extension API  
- Node.js backend (Socket.IO)
- Codeforces API
- Cheerio and Puppeteer for Problem extraction

---

## Notes

- Make sure you‚Äôre logged in to Codeforces before submitting your code.  
- Extension does **not** store your credentials ‚Äî only your Codeforces handle.  
- You can continue solving the problem even after one player wins ‚Äî great for practice!

## Future Plans

- Leaderboards & rating system  
- Support for more platforms (e.g., LeetCode, AtCoder)  
- Support submission from VS Code only
- Support Complete contest between 2 users
